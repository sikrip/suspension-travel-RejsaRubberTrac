# Suspension Travel & Tyre temp sensor for RaceChrono
A modified https://github.com/MagnusThome/RejsaRubberTrac with the following changes

* Uses a potentiometer instead of a distance sensor to measure the suspension travel
* Uses the newer MLX90640 sensor

# Usage
1. Set the name to match the corner you are going to place each device

   ``#define DEVICE_NAME "RearLeftSensor"``
2. Place the temp sensor so that the reference pin points to the back of the car
3. Take note of the potentiometer value at ride height and at full droop. Also measure the travel from
ride height to droop. Then set the following values accordingly:

    ``#define DROOP_TRAVEL -33``

    ``#define SENSOR_RIDE_HEIGHT 398``

    ``#define SENSOR_DROOP 312``
4. If you have the temp sensor connected, uncomment the following line

    ``//#define TEMP_SENSOR "tempSensor"``  
5. Added the device as "RejsaRubberTrac" in "other devices" under RaceChrone setup.
